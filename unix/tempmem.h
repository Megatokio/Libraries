	Temporary Memory Pool
	=====================

	Provides fast memory for temporary strings, e.g. for return values or in expressions.
	Any moderately-sized data which does not have a destructor can be stored in temp mem.
	See cstrings/ for the main use case.

	• pools are thread local and thus thread safe
	• automatic pool creation and destruction for each thread
	• local pools can be nested to bulk-purge local temp strings


	Basic Usage
	-----------

	Temporary memory pools are created automatically for every thread and purged when the
	thread terminates.

	Local pools can be created to bulk-purge local temp strings only in the pool's dtor,
	e.g. when a function uses cstring functions and processes large text files.

	Use tempstr(), tempmem() and temp<T> to retrieve memory from the pool:

	tempstr(len)
	  • not cleared, not aligned
	  • 1 byte for c-string delimiter is added and cleared to 0

	tempmem(size)
	  • not cleared, aligned to sizeof(ptr)

	temp<T>(count)
	  • not cleared, aligned to sizeof(T)

	You cannot return results from a function allocated in a local tempmem pool.
	use xtempstr() and xtempmem(), which allocate memory in the surrounding pool.


	Accessing Pools Directly
	------------------------

	• if you have created a local pool, then you can use the member functions allocStr(), allocMem()
	  and purge() directly with this instance.

	• TempMemPool::getPool() retrieves and may create the current pool, it never returns NULL.

	• TempMemPool::getXtPool() similarly retrieves and may create the current surrounding pool.


	Cave At
	-------

	TempMemPool uses a pthread_key. This is unique within the application, but might collide with
	keys defined somewhere else. Basically this may be interrupt threads issued from the OS,
	such as sound interrupts. Therefore you should define a local TempMemPool at each entry point
	of external threads into your application. ((evtl. this is just paranoid.))

	Don't store tempmem cstrings in exceptions unless you are shure that the exception is caught
	within the current tempmem pool's scope. Better use new/delete for cstrings in exceptions,
	because you don't know how deep they will fall.

	Don't store temp mem strings in objects which live longer than the current pool.
	Don't mix storage of new-allocated and temp mem strings in the same pointer.
	Don't pass temp strings from your pool to other threads, except you know you live longer.
