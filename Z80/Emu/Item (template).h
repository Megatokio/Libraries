/**	Simple template for class Item to get you started.

	Class Z80 is based on class Item and file "Z80.h" #includes "Item.h".
	Your "Item.h" should be placed in your project, not here.

	There should be an instance of class Machine which owns all Items.
	The components of your Machine should be based on class Item.
	Starting in Machine, Items should be "attached" in a linked list
	and the Z80 should be the first item.

	Items should reimplement the virtual functions of the Item interface as needed.
	Class Z80 does not reimplement input(), output() and update()
	because the Z80 calls these functions for all attached Items.
