/*	Simple base class for objects with reference counting
	for use with RCPtr and NVPtr.

	RCPtr and RCObject are used for automatical live-keeping and destruction of objects.
	Once an RCObject pointer is stored in an RCPtr, it may no longer be delete'd.
	instead it will be deleted when the last RCPtr pointing to it is destroyed or assigned another pointer.

	NVPtr and RCObject are used for locking volatile Objects in multi-threaded applications.
	best used in conjunction with RCPtrs.

	An own implementation, if you cannot use this base class, must implement retain() and release().

	notes:

	if RCPtr<T>::deserialize(FD&) is used,
	then class T (or a base class) must provide a static factory method T* restore(FD&).

	if App uses threads, then
	• all objects which can be accessed by multiple threads must be declared volatile.
	• this is especially true for all global variables!
	• actually ALL variables which can be accessed by multiple threads must be declared volatile,
	  though this does not help for basic types. (the compiler ignores this.)
	• to access non-volatile member functions in volatile objects, the object must be locked, then it can be cast to
	  it's non-volatile counterpart and the member function can be called, and finally it must be unlocked.
	  this is best done by storing it in a temporary/local NVPtr.
